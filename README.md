### Day 2 - Pod with Resource Limits, Requests, and Shared Volume

**Overview**: In Day 2, we focus on **Pods** and understand resource management and shared storage within a Pod.

#### Key Concepts

- **Resource Limits and Requests**: Defines the minimum and maximum CPU and memory resources for each container.
- **Shared Volume**: Enables data sharing between containers within the same Pod.

#### Essential Commands

1. **Create a Pod with resource limits and requests**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f pod-resource-limits.yaml
   ```
   - This command applies the configuration to create a Pod with specified resource limits and requests.

2. **Check Pod resource usage**:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
   ```
   - Provides detailed information about the Pod, including its resource limits and current usage.

3. **Get all running Pods**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```
   - Lists all Pods, showing their status and age.

4. **Delete a Pod**:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
   ```
   - Deletes the specified Pod from the cluster.

### Day 3 - Understanding and Managing Deployments

**Overview**: Day 3 introduces **Deployments**, which automate managing, scaling, and updating applications in Kubernetes.

#### Key Concepts

- **Creating a Deployment**: Defines a desired state for Pods and manages the deployment process.
- **Updating Deployments**: Uses strategies like **RollingUpdate** and **Recreate**.
- **Rollbacks**: Reverts to a previous stable state when needed.

#### Essential Commands

1. **Create or update a Deployment**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```
   - Creates or updates a Deployment using a configuration file.

2. **Scale a Deployment**:
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=3
   ```
   - Changes the number of Pod replicas for a Deployment to match the specified count.

3. **Monitor Deployment rollout status**:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout status deployment <deployment-name>
   ```
   - Shows the status of the Deployment rollout, useful for monitoring ongoing updates.

4. **Undo a Deployment to the previous revision**:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout undo deployment <deployment-name>
   ```
   - Rolls back the Deployment to its previous configuration if an update fails.

5. **View Deployment details**:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>
   ```
   - Provides detailed information about the Deployment, including the ReplicaSets it manages.

### Day 4 - Working with ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, and Probes

**Overview**: Day 4 covers **ReplicaSets**, **DaemonSets**, and **Probes**, crucial for cluster reliability and application health.

#### Key Concepts

- **ReplicaSets**: Ensures a specified number of replicas are running, typically managed by Deployments.
- **DaemonSets**: Runs a Pod on all or specified nodes in a cluster.
- **Probes**: Health checks to determine if Pods are running and ready to serve traffic.

#### Essential Commands

1. **Create a ReplicaSet**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml
   ```
   - Deploys a ReplicaSet configuration to manage a set number of replicas for a Pod.

2. **Scale a ReplicaSet**:
   ```bash
   kubectl scale replicaset <replicaset-name> --replicas=3
   ```
   - Changes the number of replicas managed by the ReplicaSet.

3. **Create a DaemonSet**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f daemonset.yaml
   ```
   - Deploys a DaemonSet to run a Pod on each node in the cluster.

4. **Get DaemonSet details**:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe daemonset <daemonset-name>
   ```
   - Shows detailed information about the DaemonSet and the nodes itâ€™s running on.

5. **Check Pod health with Probes**:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
   ```
   - Displays the status of Probes, including **Liveness**, **Readiness**, and **Startup** Probes, for a Pod.

6. **Delete a DaemonSet**:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete daemonset <daemonset-name>
   ```
   - Removes the DaemonSet and all Pods it manages from the cluster.

### Day 6 - Volumes Explained: ConfigMaps, Persistent Volumes (PV), and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)

**Overview**: Day 6 explores **Volumes** in Kubernetes, focusing on **ConfigMaps**, **Persistent Volumes (PV)**, and **Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)** for persistent storage and dynamic configuration.

#### Key Concepts

- **ConfigMaps**: Stores configuration data outside of container images, allowing for easy configuration changes.
- **Persistent Volumes (PV)**: Cluster-level storage resources, separate from Pods.
- **Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)**: Requests for PVs, enabling Pods to use persistent storage.

#### Essential Commands

1. **Create a ConfigMap**:
   ```bash
   kubectl create configmap <configmap-name> --from-literal=<key>=<value>
   ```
   - Creates a ConfigMap directly from the command line.

2. **Get ConfigMap details**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get configmap <configmap-name> -o yaml
   ```
   - Displays the contents of the ConfigMap in YAML format.

3. **Create a Persistent Volume (PV)**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f persistent-volume.yaml
   ```
   - Deploys a Persistent Volume to the cluster, specifying storage capacity and access modes.

4. **Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f persistent-volume-claim.yaml
   ```
   - Requests storage from a PV for use by Pods.

5. **View Persistent Volumes and Claims**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pv
   kubectl get pvc
   ```
   - Lists all Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims, showing their status and capacity.

6. **Delete a Persistent Volume or PVC**:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete -f persistent-volume.yaml
   kubectl delete pvc <pvc-name>
   ```
   - Deletes specified Persistent Volumes and/or Claims.
